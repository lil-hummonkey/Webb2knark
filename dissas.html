        Dissociatives (also referred to as 'dissociative anaesthetics') are a class of psychedelic drug. This class of drug causes people to feel separated or detached from their body or physical environment.

Dissociatives can also cause hallucinations and other changes in thoughts, emotions and consciousness.
