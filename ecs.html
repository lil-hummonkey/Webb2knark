        Empathogens increase a personâ€™s feeling of empathy and benevolence towards others, as well as feelings of being socially accepted and connected.

They can increase friendliness and playfulness, but can also cause mood swings, dehydration and depression. Empathogens are sometimes referred to as entactogens.

    <h3>Empathogens and the brain</h3>
    <div>
        
        
        Empathogens cause the release of dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Serotonin controls mood, appetite and sleep, and can make you feel relaxed.

Using empathogens can cause the serotonin levels in the brain to become very low, and can also lead to hyperthermia (over-heating).
