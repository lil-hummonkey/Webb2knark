                Drugs come in many different forms. Some are prescribed by pharmacies, some can be bought at your local supermarket and some are heavily regulated illegal substances. Often we are taught that these clasicifactions are the nuance with substances; Illegal drugs are bad and have no use, legal drugs are good and should be supported and even indulged (take anti-depressants for treating depression as an example). This however ignores that drugs are complex and have varying effects for not only the people who use them but the situation they are used in. It is also worth noting that the idea of all illegal drugs being bad causes both alienation for addicts and a lack of education on safety for people who decide to try these substances. This website is a collection of information on how to safely use/mix drugs, and what to stay away from v/s what has applications.
