        Depressant substances reduce arousal and stimulation. They affect the central nervous system, slowing down the messages between the brain and body.

They can affect concentration and coordination and slow down a person’s ability to respond to unexpected situations. In small doses, they can cause a person to feel more relaxed and less inhibited.1

In larger doses they can cause drowsiness, vomiting, unconsciousness and death.

    <h3>How are depressants used?</h3>
    <div>
        How they’re used depends on the specific type of depressant. For example, alcohol is drunk and benzodiazepines are usually swallowed - but they can also be injected.

Generally, depressants can be swallowed, drunk, injected, snorted or inhaled.
